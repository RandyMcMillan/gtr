# GTR

This is am attempt to decentralize the service you are reading this at.

# Alternatives and my problems with them:
- https://scuttlebot.io/apis/community/git-ssb.html (uses scuttelbut for communication and commits things like PRs, etc to repo itself)
- https://radicle.xyz/ - (Involved into shitcoinery)

Use torrent/dht as a transport layer for git. Here is the implementation https://github.com/cjb/GitTorrent which I am taking as an inspiration. The particular implementation consists of the following parts:
  - `gti` - a CLI tool;
  - `gtd` - a daemon. It creates server (one for each local repo?) which handles requests routed by dht to send necessary pack files;
  - `git-remote-gtr` - a transport that handles communication with dht accessed by git's remote commands like (`clone`, `fetch`, `pull` etc);
  - `git-interface`:
    - generates pack files (either upon request from `gtd` or upon each new commit by git)
    - lists available branches and their corresponding references
  - `exporter` - a module reposinsible for:
    - persistent settings of repository/branch to share
    - for making sure that daemon is always up and running while inheriting correct settings

Use some decentralized messaging protocols for implementation of things like PRs, Issues, Reviews etc. Currently I consider:
  - nostr https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr
  - slashtags https://github.com/synonymdev/slashtags
  - torrent
  - ...

# UX
The goal is to keep UX as close to plain git is possible. There is one nuance however. This might require a trade off where there will be one DHT server instance running per each repo.

To clone a branch use a command `git clone gtr://<hex sha1>/reponame` - where `sha1` - is a sha1 of mutable key on DHT. This can be converted to `git clone gtr://<user>/reponame` with `sha1` being mapped to `username` on decentralized messaging protocol like nostr or slashtags

Alternatively it might make sense to forward all commands straight to git intercepting few of them, executing necessary logic and passing them further.


## User flow
XXX: note that there is no "repository" as such. Each branch gets announced. The `HEAD`/`master` branches are announced by default and each new branch gets added separately.

1. Create git repository if it does not yet exists and perform usual development flow;
2. Instead of pushing to remote, announce branch. This will make it available on torrent network. There are two possible flows with torrent protocol:
  - `announce` - the source is hosted on the local machine while is available via torrent (e.g. key is pushed to DHT with value staying locally). This will require a server listening locally for connection requests, this will allow counterparties to lookup necessary branch/repo on DHT with consequent connection to local server for downloading;
  - `put` - the source is stored on DHT (e.g. both key and value stored in distributed manner over the network).

### Client mode (`git-remote-gtr`)
- no `git push` but `announce`/`put` branch to DHT instead
- no `git pull` but `get` branch from DHT instead

### Server mode (`gtd`)
- no `push` but `announce`/`put` branch to DHT instead
