// XXX UX:
// Original gittorrent allows user to share all/many dirs from common parent directory by running gittorrentd in it.
// All leaves that have `.gtr/gittorrent-daemon-export-ok` file will be shared but only their master and head.
//
// TODO: FIXME: the approach described bellow is wrong as it will require one web server per repo!
// My approach so far is to share repo by running gittorrentd in it (or at the moment, passing dirname)
// and providing branches to share as arguments, with master (and HEAD?) being defaults. The list of provided branches will
// be stored in `.gtr/gittorrentd-daemon-export` file
//
// NOTE: UX/Arch: 
// 1. TODO: stop passing directory as a first argument, and always use current directory (for
//    testing purposes there might be a trade-off with allowing to be passed as env var or option
// 2. When user uses tool for multiple local repositories, the new DHT instance should be created
//    once but reused for all future cases. It also might make sense to disable "seeding" through
//    some persisted configurable option. DHT instance needs to be started after reboot.

// NOTE: basic CLI functionality might be completed in current implementation
//
// XXX consider split for CLI and Daemon or ALTERNATIVE: provide gtr CLI as tool which will act as a wrapper for git.
// By default it passes commands to git and lets git execute them. With few following exceptions:
// * `init` passes to git and does what current implementation of `setup` does with default branches
// * `push` adds branch to list of shared branches?
// * ...
// For private repository utilize idea of gitconfig with settings for private/public repos and for list of user's keys
// who are allowed to download it. For this bittorrent's handshake/seeding process must be tweaked.
//
// TODO: create nested "test" directory to run tests within it.
// TODO: (what is this) read branches from file? get their hash from git follow original gittorrent
// TODO: write integration test
